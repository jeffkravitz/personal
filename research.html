          My past research has focused on topics including moral judgment, emotion, stress, mindfulness, and 
          decision making. These projects have drawn upon social, cognitive, and evolutionary psychology in order
          to produce impactful, multidisciplinary research. Click below to read more!

              My thesis research at Brooklyn College focused on the distinct social functions of 
              disgust and anger in morality. Specifically, I theorized that anger, an approach-tendency 
              emotion, causes us to engage with those who have transgressed to elicit behavioral 
              changes in the transgressor, placing us in immediate precarious situations but 
              maximizing positive outcomes in the future. In contrast, when a transgressor has 
              stable, negative traits (bad moral character) the likelihood of inciting behavioral 
              change decreases, and the avoidance-tendencies of disgust instead function to withdraw 
              from the transgressor, reducing the likelihood of becoming the target of future 
              immoral behavior.

              In a second line of research, I am currently developing a study that aims to 
              determine whether automatic processes such as stress have a causal role in moral 
              judgment or if they are merely the result of such judgment. This study utilizes 
              false physiological feedback to test the hypothesis that perceived stress causes 
              more severe moral judgment. In the experiment, participants wear headphones and 
              are told that they are listening to their own heartbeat; in reality, they are 
              randomly assigned to hear either a fast or normal heartbeat. I hypothesize that 
              participants in the fast-heartbeat condition will attribute their perceived stress 
              response to moral transgressions presented in a vignette, and thus judge them more 
              severely. Further, I hypothesize that this effect will be moderated by mindfulness 
              such that people high in mindfulness will be aware of and non-reactive to their 
              physiological feedback, and thus judge less severely than those lower in mindfulness.

        <button class="accordion">Mindfulness Meditation and Decision Making<div class="accordion-right">Stony Brook University</div></button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
              In Stony Brook University’s Psychology Honors Program, I conducted independent 
              research under the guidance of my mentor and research advisor Dr. Nancy Franklin. 
              My honors project focused on whether mindfulness meditation can reduce inherent bias in 
              decision-making. People have the tendeny to devalue future rewards, a phenomenon known as 
              delay discounting. Delay discounting is widely used as a measure of impulsivity. Mindfulness 
              meditation is a practice that emphasizes a present-focused, non-reactive awareness of one’s 
              experiences; in essence, control over one’s attention and emotions. I hypothesized that a 
              single session of guided mindfulness meditation would reduce delay discounting rates by 
              causing people to be non-reactive to their impulses. The results of the study supported 
              this idea.

          <p>
              As my introduction to psychology research as an undergraduate, I worked in Dr. Nancy 
              Franklin’s memory lab. In the lab, I worked on a project that aimed to determine the 
              effect of anger on memory through the use of a boundary extension paradigm. The primary 
              hypothesis of this study was that anger, an approach-tendency emotion, causes people to 
              focus on central aspects of experience, and would thus cause recognition of a zoomed-in 
              version of an original image.

            <h3>Moral Judgment and Emotion</h3>
            My thesis research at Brooklyn College focuses on the distinct social functions of 
            moral disgust and anger. Specifically, I theorize that anger, an approach-tendency 
            emotion, causes us to engage with those who have transgressed to elicit behavioral 
            changes in the transgressor, placing us in immediate precarious situations but 
            maximizing positive outcomes in the future. In contrast, when a transgressor has 
            stable, negative traits (bad moral character) the likelihood of inciting behavioral 
            change decreases, and the avoidance-tendencies of disgust instead function to withdraw 
            from the transgressor, reducing the likelihood of becoming the target of future 
            immoral behavior.<br><br>

            <h3>Moral Judgment, Stress, and Mindfulness</h3>
            In a second line of research, I am currently developing a study that aims to 
            determine whether automatic processes such as stress have a causal role in moral 
            judgment or if they are merely the result of such judgment. This study utilizes 
            false physiological feedback to test the hypothesis that perceived stress causes 
            more severe moral judgment. In the experiment, participants wear headphones and 
            are told that they are listening to their own heartbeat; in reality, they are 
            randomly assigned to hear either a fast or normal heartbeat. I hypothesize that 
            participants in the fast-heartbeat condition will attribute their perceived stress 
            response to moral transgressions presented in a vignette, and thus judge them more 
            severely. Further, I hypothesize that this effect will be moderated by mindfulness 
            such that people high in mindfulness will be aware of and non-reactive to their 
            physiological feedback, and thus judge less severely than those lower in mindfulness.

            <h3>Mindfulness Meditation and Decision Making</h3>
            In Stony Brook University’s Honors Program, I conducted independent 
            research under the guidance of my mentor and research advisor Dr. Nancy Franklin. 
            My honors project focused on the effect of mindfulness meditation on delay discounting 
            rates. Delay discounting refers to the tendency to behave as though future rewards are 
            less valuable than equivalent immediate rewards. Mindfulness meditation is a practice 
            that emphasizes a present-focused, non-reactive awareness of one’s experiences; in 
            essence, control over one’s attention and emotions. Because mindfulness meditation has 
            been identified as an effective treatment for self-control disorders such as substance 
            abuse and binge eating disorders, I hypothesized that a single session of guided 
            mindfulness meditation would reduce delay discounting rates, or in other words, reduce 
            the rate at which people devalue future rewards.

            <h3>Anger and Boundary Extension</h3>
            As my introduction to psychology research as an undergraduate, I worked in Dr. Nancy 
            Franklin’s memory lab. In the lab, I worked on a project that aimed to determine the 
            effect of anger on memory through the use of a boundary extension paradigm. The primary 
            hypothesis of this study was that anger, an approach-tendency emotion, causes people to 
            focus on central aspects of experience, and would thus cause recognition of a zoomed-in 
            version of an original image.<br><br><br><br>
